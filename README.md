ArcGIS and R Integration: A Twitter Toolbox
========

This is an example of how R can now be linked to ArcGIS to create a Toolbox. In this example the Twitter API is used to return a set of geolocated Tweets from a user specified query that are then converted into a Shapefile.

This code is far from production and there is no error handling, as was designed as an illustrative example, and is featured in the blog post which can be found [here]().
